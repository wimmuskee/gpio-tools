This Bash library contains functions to control a GPIO and the signals of the Beaglebone. Other board libraries and signal-to-pin mappings can be integrated easily.

Installation:
 - git clone git://github.com/wimmuskee/gpio-tools.git
 - cp -r gpio-tools /usr/share/.
 - cp gpio-tools/bin/* /usr/bin/.

 Usage:
 - lsgpio       Shows /sys/kernel/debug/gpio
 - lsgpio -a    Exports current signal settings as csv file.
 
 For library usage, see the files in the examples dir.
